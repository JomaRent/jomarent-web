    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Data Controller Identification</h2>
<p>JOMA Alquiler de Maquinaria S.L., with Tax Identification Number (CIF) B75806885 and registered address at Calle Utiel, 22, 46360 Buñol (Valencia, Spain), is the entity responsible for processing the personal data collected through the website jomarent.com (hereinafter, “the Website”). This Privacy Policy complies with Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as well as with the applicable Spanish legislation on the matter, particularly Organic Law 3/2018 on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD).</p>
<p>For any questions related to data protection, you may contact the Company at the above postal address or via email at info@jomarent.com.</p>
<h2>Personal Data Collected and Purposes of Processing</h2>
<p>Personal data is collected on the Website solely through the contact form, which requests basic identifying and contact information. As a general rule, the data that may be requested includes the name, email address, phone number (if applicable), and any other information voluntarily provided by the user in the message field.</p>
<p>Purpose: The personal data provided by the user through the contact form will be processed solely for the purpose of managing and responding to their inquiry, request, or information demand. JOMA will use this data to contact the user and provide the requested information about our solar industry machinery rental services, handle any potential quote or service requests, and maintain communications arising from the user's initial inquiry. Under no circumstances will we use the user's data to send unsolicited commercial communications (SPAM) or for purposes other than those explicitly stated.</p>
<p>Legal Basis (Legitimation):</p>
<p>The legal basis that legitimizes the processing of the user’s data is the user’s free, specific, informed, and unequivocal consent, which is provided when submitting a query through the Website. This consent is obtained, for example, by ticking the corresponding checkbox to accept this Privacy Policy before submitting the form.</p>
<p>If the user’s request is related to a potential service agreement, the processing of their data may also be based on the application of pre-contractual measures at the request of the data subject, in accordance with Article 6.1.b of the GDPR (as necessary for steps prior to entering into a contract).</p>

<p>The user agrees that the information provided through the contact form is truthful, accurate, and up to date. JOMA shall not be held liable for any damages or harm that may result for the user or third parties due to the provision of false, inaccurate, or incomplete data.</p>

<p>Likewise, our services are intended for adults only, and JOMA does not knowingly collect information from minors under 14 years of age. In the event that a minor under the age of 14 has submitted personal data via the Website without parental or guardian consent, we will delete such data immediately upon becoming aware of the situation.</p>

<h2>Data Retention Period</h2>
<p>JOMA will retain the personal data collected through the Website only for the time necessary to properly address and manage the user's request, respond to their questions, or fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected.</p>

<p>Once the data is no longer necessary for that purpose, it may be securely stored in a blocked state (restricted access and protection measures in place) for an additional period, solely to meet potential legal obligations arising from the processing. Specifically, if no subsequent commercial relationship is established between the user and JOMA, the data from the inquiry will not be retained for more than one (1) year from the last interaction, unless a legal obligation requires it to be kept for a longer period.</p>

<p>If, following the initial communication, a contractual relationship is established (e.g., signing a machinery rental agreement), the data will be retained for the duration of that relationship and, afterward, for the period required by applicable laws (e.g., tax and accounting regulations, which typically require documentation to be retained for 4 to 6 years). During this subsequent period, the data will remain blocked and will only be processed to comply with such legal obligations or for the formulation, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Once the legally mandated retention periods have expired, the personal data will be securely deleted.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Data to Third Parties</h2>
<p>JOMA will not transfer or disclose users' personal data to third parties, except in the following situations: (i) when required by law or by a competent authority, in which case JOMA may disclose only the data strictly necessary to comply with such legal obligation, or (ii) if it is essential to provide the service requested by the user, in which case the user will be duly informed (for example, providing the necessary data to a transport company if required to deliver rented machinery, following the formalization of a contract).</p>

<p>In particular, the data collected through the contact form will not be shared for advertising purposes or transferred to third parties for commercial uses unrelated to the purposes described. However, JOMA may rely on the collaboration of service providers acting as data processors on behalf of the Company. For example, the web hosting service or the technological platform of the Website may be provided by third parties, which means that these providers may have incidental access to personal data or access it when necessary to perform the service we provide (e.g., technical maintenance of the website or sending response emails). In all cases, JOMA signs data processing agreements with these providers, legally requiring them to use the information solely for the agreed purpose, maintain confidentiality, and implement adequate security measures to protect the data.</p>

<p>Outside the cases explained above, JOMA will not carry out international data transfers to countries outside the European Economic Area, unless the user has been informed and the requirements established by the applicable regulations are met (e.g., prior consent or another appropriate legal basis and adequate safeguards in the destination country). At present, all personal data processing is carried out within the European Union.</p>

<h2>User Rights (ARSULIPO Rights)</h2>
<p>The user, as the data subject whose personal data may be processed by JOMA, is entitled to exercise a series of data protection rights at any time. In particular, and in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR, the user may request to exercise the ARSULIPO rights, which include the following:</p>


<p>Right of Access: to know what personal data we are processing about you, the origin of such data, and to obtain information about the processing activities carried out with them. This right allows the data subject to confirm whether JOMA is processing their personal data and, if so, to receive a copy of such data along with complete information regarding the purposes, data categories, recipients, retention periods, and the rights they are entitled to.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Rectification: </strong>to request the correction of inaccurate, erroneous, or incomplete personal data held by JOMA. If any of your personal data has changed or is simply incorrect, you have the right to have it rectified without undue delay.</li>

<li><strong>Right to Erasure: </strong>to request the deletion of your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purpose it was collected, when the consent on which the processing was based is withdrawn, or when the data subject believes the data is being processed unlawfully. This right is also known as the "right to be forgotten" and allows the data subject to request the deletion of their data when any of the legal grounds apply.</li>

<li><strong>Right to Restriction of Processing: </strong>to request that JOMA temporarily suspend the processing of your personal data when certain conditions are met. For example, if the accuracy of your data is contested, while such accuracy is verified; or if the data subject has objected to a processing based on legitimate interest, while it is determined whether JOMA’s legitimate grounds override those of the data subject. During this restriction period, JOMA will store the data securely and only process it for retention or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>

<li><strong>Right to Data Portability: </strong>to receive a copy of your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and to transmit it to another data controller by yourself or, if technically feasible, through JOMA. This right applies when processing is based on the data subject's consent or on a contract, and it is carried out by automated means. The data subject may also request, if technically possible, that JOMA directly transfers such data to the new controller they designate.</li>

<li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> to object at any time, based on your particular situation, to the processing of your personal data when such processing is based on public interest or JOMA’s or another party’s legitimate interest. In such cases, JOMA will stop processing the data for those purposes unless compelling legitimate grounds prevail over the interests, rights, and freedoms of the data subject, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, the user has the right to withdraw their consent at any time. This means that, if the processing of their data is based on consent, they may revoke it, and JOMA must cease processing for the relevant purpose. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of prior processing based on such consent. Furthermore, the user has the right not to be subject to automated individual decisions, including profiling, that produce legal effects or similarly significantly affect them. However, JOMA confirms that it does not carry out any data processing involving automated decision-making without human intervention or profiling that could have legal or significant effects on the user.</p>

<p>To exercise these rights, users may contact JOMA in writing via any of the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Postal mail: </strong>by sending a written request (including a copy of your ID, NIE, or equivalent document to verify your identity) to the following address: JOMA Alquiler de Maquinaria S.L., Calle Utiel, 22, 46360 Buñol (Valencia, Spain), indicating on the envelope: “Data Protection – ARSULIPO Rights”.</li>

<li><strong>Email:</strong> by sending a message from the same email address used in the contact form, addressed to info@jomarent.com, with the subject line “Exercise of ARSULIPO rights” and clearly indicating which right you wish to exercise. In this case, JOMA may request additional information or documentation to confirm your identity if there is any doubt about the applicant.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will handle your request without undue delay and, in any case, within a maximum period of one month from receipt. This period may be extended by up to two additional months if necessary (depending on the complexity and number of requests, as allowed by the GDPR). If so, we will inform you of the extension within the first month. The exercise of these rights is free of charge, except in cases where requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in which case JOMA reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee (proportional to the administrative costs incurred) or to refuse to act (providing justification).</p>

<p>Lastly, we inform you that you have the right to file a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD) (https://www.aepd.es), or with another relevant supervisory authority competent in your place of residence if you live outside Spain, especially if you are not satisfied with the outcome of the exercise of your rights. However, before submitting a formal complaint, we encourage you to contact us first to try to resolve the matter amicably.</p>

<h2>Security Measures</h2>

<p>JOMA takes the security of personal data very seriously. Accordingly, it has adopted appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk and to protect personal data under its responsibility against unauthorized access, alteration, loss, or accidental destruction. These measures are based on the nature of the data processed, the risks to which the data may be exposed, and technological advancements, in accordance with the GDPR and Spanish data protection regulations.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Website uses a secure (HTTPS) connection and SSL/TLS encryption for transmitting the information users may enter in the forms, to prevent improper interception of the data. Additionally, JOMA’s servers and IT systems are equipped with perimeter protection, access controls, regular backups, firewalls, and other tools designed to prevent security breaches.</p>

<p>Although no system is completely invulnerable, JOMA regularly reviews and updates its security policies and measures to adapt to legislative developments, technological progress, identified vulnerabilities, or changes in the nature of the data processed. If JOMA detects a security breach that significantly affects users’ personal data, it undertakes to notify the relevant authorities and the affected individuals, as required under the GDPR.</p>

<h2>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>

<p>Currently, the website jomarent.com does not use first-party or third-party cookies for analytics, advertising, or user profiling purposes. Only technical cookies — if any — are used, which are necessary for the basic functioning of the Website. These technical cookies (for example, those that allow temporarily remembering information entered in a form during navigation) are exempt from consent under current regulations, as their purpose is to ensure the proper functioning and security of the Website, without collecting the user’s personal information.</p>

<p>Users may configure their browser to block or delete cookies, including technical cookies, if they so wish. However, please note that disabling technical cookies through browser settings may cause certain features of the Website to function improperly. Since no non-essential cookies are used on this Website, the typical cookie banner or notice is not displayed upon access, in accordance with current legislation (Directive 2002/58/EC and Spanish Law 34/2002, known as the LSSI-CE, regarding the use of cookies).</p>

<h2>Acceptance and Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Accessing and using the Website, as well as submitting a request or communication through the contact form, implies awareness and acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy. This policy is intended to inform you of your rights and how we process your data; if you do not agree with any of the terms set out herein, please do not submit your personal data via the forms on this Website.</p>

<p>JOMA reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy whenever necessary — for example, to comply with legislative or case law changes or to reflect new business practices. Any significant changes will be communicated to users through the Website (via notices on the page) or by other available means of contact, as appropriate, so they can stay informed about the updates. In any case, the current version of this Privacy Policy will always be accessible on the Website, indicating the date of the latest update.</p>
