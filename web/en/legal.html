<h2>Terms of Use</h2>
<p>This Legal Notice governs access to and use of the Website made available by JOMA to Internet users. Accessing the Website implies the status of user and full, unconditional acceptance of these terms of use. If the user does not agree with these terms, they must refrain from using the Website.</p>

<p>The user agrees to use the Website, its contents and services in accordance with the law, this Legal Notice, good faith, and generally accepted good practices. The Website may not be used for unlawful, misleading, malicious, or harmful purposes against JOMA or third parties, or in any way that may damage or hinder the normal functioning of the Website. The user will be liable for any damages that may arise from improper use of the Website.</p>

<p>JOMA reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently discontinue access to the Website at any time and without prior notice, whether due to technical, security, maintenance, power outage, or any other reason. JOMA also reserves the right to unilaterally modify the presentation, configuration, or content of the Website and these terms of use at any time. The Company will attempt, when circumstances permit, to provide prior notice of any such interruptions or changes. JOMA shall not be held liable for any suspension or modification of the Website.</p>

<h2>Intellectual and Industrial Property</h2>
<p>All contents on the Website (including but not limited to: text, photographs, graphics, images, icons, software, source code, designs, logos, trademarks, trade names, and audiovisual or sound content, as well as the graphic design and source code) are protected by intellectual and industrial property rights owned by JOMA or for which JOMA holds valid licenses. Access to or use of the Website does not grant the user any rights of transfer, license, or use over said content beyond strictly personal and private use.</p>

<p>Reproduction, distribution, public communication, transformation, extraction, reuse, retransmission, or any other exploitation of the Website’s content, by any means or procedure, without prior written authorization from JOMA or the rightful owner, is strictly prohibited. Specifically, the inclusion of any content from this Website on other websites, platforms, or media is not permitted. The user agrees to respect the intellectual and industrial property rights of JOMA and any third parties.</p>

<p>However, the user may view and temporarily download a private copy of the Website’s content for their exclusive personal, non-commercial use, provided it does not serve any commercial or professional purpose. The user must refrain from deleting, altering, bypassing, or tampering with any security devices or protection systems that may be installed on the Website.</p>

<h2>Personal Data Protection</h2>
<p>JOMA is committed to protecting the privacy of its Website users. In compliance with current legislation on personal data protection—particularly Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Organic Law 3/2018 on Personal Data Protection and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD)—any personal data provided by users during use of the Website will be processed in accordance with JOMA’s Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>In particular, if a user fills out the Website’s contact form and provides personal data (e.g., name, email, phone number), such data will only be processed to manage the request for information or contact, as detailed in the Privacy Policy. JOMA guarantees that it has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to safeguard personal data, and that all processing is carried out in accordance with the principles and rights established under applicable data protection laws.

<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties and Liability</h2>
<p>The content of the Website is of a general nature and is intended solely to provide information about the services offered by JOMA (rental of specialized machinery for the solar sector). While JOMA strives to keep the information accurate and up to date, it does not guarantee the complete accuracy, timeliness, or error-free nature of all content. Therefore, JOMA assumes no responsibility regarding the accuracy or currency of the information published on the Website. Likewise, the Company does not guarantee uninterrupted availability or continuous operation of the Website and shall not be held liable for damages resulting from service interruptions, access problems, or other issues beyond its reasonable control.</p>

<p>JOMA shall not be liable for any damages that the user may suffer as a result of visiting the Website, including but not limited to: errors or omissions in the content, lack of availability of the portal, or the transmission of viruses or other harmful programs, despite having taken all necessary technological measures to prevent such incidents. It is the user’s responsibility to have appropriate tools for detecting and disinfecting harmful software.</p>

<p>The Website may contain links or hyperlinks to third-party websites. These links are provided solely for the convenience of users and to offer access to information, content, and services provided by entities unrelated to JOMA. JOMA does not control or review the content of such external pages and therefore cannot guarantee nor be held liable for their legality, reliability, accuracy, timeliness, or quality. The inclusion of these links does not imply any relationship, recommendation, or oversight by JOMA regarding the destination websites. Users access such external sites entirely at their own risk and under the conditions of use established therein.</p>

<h2>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>In general, any disputes arising from access to and use of the Website between JOMA and the user shall be governed by Spanish law. In the event of any conflict or disagreement in the interpretation or application of these terms, and unless consumer protection regulations provide otherwise, both parties agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the Courts and Tribunals of the city of Valencia (Spain), expressly waiving any other jurisdiction that may apply.</p>
